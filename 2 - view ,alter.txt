ALTERING THE TABLES
Here, we will alter a particular table.
For example , here we will alter works_on table.

it consists of same fields as above.

DROP COMMAND USAGE:
DROP TABLE command is used to delete the complete table, but it will remove
complete table data and structure both. You need to re-create the table again if you
have to store some data.
Here, we will create a table called locations with the fields districts and pincode to
perform the drop operation.
MySQL> drop table locations;

RENAMING THE TABLE:
It simply renames the table.
MySQL> rename table locations to locationhub;
